# Similar Projects
Fhere are many other projects similar to `pokemon-colorscripts` in the "printing out pokemon to terminal utilities" space.
Two of the notable projects that I have come across are [pokeget](https://github.com/talwat/pokeget) and [pokeshell](https://github.com/acxz/pokeshell).
Both of them are really cool projects and hope to achieve slightly different results than `pokemon-colorscripts`.

## Pokeshell
As far as I can tell `pokeshell` aims to be a much more feature rich program than 
`pokemon-colorscripts` at the expense of added dependencies and possibly speed.
As pokeshell uses images instead of simple text files, it allows `pokeshell` 
to be much more flexible with what it can display. 
Some of the advantages of `pokeshell` that caught my attention are
- Animated sprites
- Different sizes for pokemon
- Different forms
- Fits to terminal
- Bash completions

You can see a much more exhaustive list and also some comparisons with other programs on the [Pokeshell readme](https://github.com/acxz/pokeshell)
. Although some features like completions, forms, and different sizes are features I plan on adding to `pokemon-colorscripts`,
features like animated sprites are well out of scope for this project. 
So if you want to use a more featured counterpart for this project, please do consider using `pokeshell`.

## Pokeget

`pokeget` is mostly similar in spirit and features to `pokemon-colorscripts` with the key difference being `pokeget`
live fetches the sprites over the network from its github repo when displaying the pokemon. 
This allows for more robust updates to sprites and such from the deveoper side without the user having to do anything.
However this also causes `pokeget` to be slightly slower and dependent on network availability and speed. 
Some of the other notable advantages I've observed pokeget having are
- More comprehensive packaging and releases
- Much neater way to uninstall the program
- Some fixes to sprites like larger pokemon having blurry sprites in `pokemon-colorscripts`
- More forms and also front and back sprites

some of these are features I eventually plan on implementing in `pokemon-colorscripts` as well.

## Conclusion

Both of these are really cool projects and please do consider checking them out and using them if they suit your needs.
Also star, fork, contribute, support developers and all that jazz for both projects. There is plenty of room in the pokemon terminal space.
